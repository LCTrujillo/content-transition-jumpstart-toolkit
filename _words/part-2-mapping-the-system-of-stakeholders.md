title: "Part 2: Mapping the system of stakeholders"
position: 5

In Part 1, we covered a number of topics regarding the department or working group you’re project is directly partnering with to improve a city service. As we’ve already noted, that organization does not exist as an island, but rather is incredibly interwoven and interdependent within a larger system of city groups.  Meaningful engagement, and truly your project’s success, means expanding your view beyond your partner to all key players involved. Why? Because success means thinking long-term: what will you innovate through this project, and how will it impact the rest of the system? To create enduring transformation, you need the buy-in, support, and collaboration of key staff across the system.

You’ve conducted [project planning conversations](#) with project leadership, and [introduction conversations](#) with staff in the partnering organization. Now, you’re ready to have system stakeholder conversations. You and your team will be:

[Identifying "tentacles"](#)

[Emphasizing stakeholder conversations](#)

[Mapping the system](#)

## Identifying "tentacles"

In order to conduct conversations with stakeholders in the system, you need to identify all key players related to [the process in scope]. There are two types of key players with what we think of as "tentacles" somehow touching the service your project aims to improve:

* Those whose work is involved in the process

* Those whose work impacts the process

Those involved in the process are usually pretty easy to spot; they’re closely involved with the process so their tentacle is pretty short. When you ask staff who are key players involved in [the process in scope], these are the groups you’ll hear first. On the other hand, those impacting the process are more indirectly involved, so their tentacle is much longer. You’ll need to specifically ask who impacts the process to identify them. Those with long tentacles are often overlooked because they don’t seem to own the process or manage it on a daily basis. Yet, they are still very important and should be engaged as key players.

*Considerations:*

* [Snowball sampling](#) will come in handy here. That method not only helps you identify all obvious key players, it also leads you to groups and staff who are more hidden in the system.

* Look through your notes from [project planning](#) and [introduction conversations](#). Staff likely identified key players in your conversations. Reach out and ask them for an introduction!

* Reach out to your highly engaged, your "sneezers!" Ask them for their help reviewing your identified groups so far and suggest ones you’ve missed. In enlisting their help, you are engaging them as forces of good on the project and showing your respect for their expertise.

## Emphasizing stakeholder conversations

Your conversations with system stakeholders include all the elements and guidance laid out in our [general considerations](#), plus:

* INTRODUCTIONS
  * YOU - Learn how they are connected to [the process in scope].
  * PROJECT - Learn their current understanding of the project. Share your team’s starting point and current status
	* *Sample script*
    * "We appreciate that it takes a number of city departments and working groups to make the [process in scope] run smoothly. So we’re trying to connect with all groups who are involved or impact the process to share with them about the project and learn what resonates from this project with their needs...We’d also like to share the groups we’ve identified so far to see if you think we’re missing any."
    * EXPECTATIONS - Share the scope of the project, the role that other groups besides [the partnering organization] can play in the project, and opportunities to serve in advisory or project champion roles.

## Mapping the system

Develop a map of all groups impacting or involved in delivery of the service as you go, and keep track of a point of contact for each. This map can be as simple as a mind map or spreadsheet. Here’s an example of a simple map we created as we were learning the departments involved in Austin’s residential permitting process:
