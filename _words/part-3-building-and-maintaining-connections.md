## Connecting People in the System

You and your team are lucky. Through your work on this project, you’ve gotten to scan the landscape surrounding [the process in scope], and develop a robust lay of the land including all key players. Do you know how many city staff have the birds eye view that you and your team now have? From our experience, not many. Your task then, is to pay that incredibly valuable insight forward to others. The approach to engagement we’re proposing to you in this guide is one based on conversations. Conversations that fuel meaningful connections. Here we describe a couple different ways you can help connect people in the system:

[Making introductions on an ongoing basis](#making-introductions-on-an-ongoing-basis)

[Making introductions at project reviews and public share-outs](#making-introductions-at-project-reviews-and-public-share-outs)

### Making introductions on an ongoing basis

Because you listened closely and captured all sorts of valuable intel during [project planning](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-1-learning-from-the-organization#emphasizing-project-planning-conversations), [introduction](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-1-learning-from-the-organization#emphasizing-introduction-conversations), and [stakeholder conversations](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-2-mapping-the-system-of-stakeholders#emphasizing-stakeholder-conversations), you know about the "Taj Mahal" needs of a diverse array of project stakeholders. How amazing! You are in a position to look for connections.

What does one person need that another person has? Consider: someone in Department A mentions something that you think someone else in Department B could help them with. Offer to make an introduction. Always find ways to add value for all staff with "tentacles" touching the project, not just the organization with whom you’re partnered. You are building broad buy-in and support, as well as identifying “sneezers” and additional city groups to partner with on future projects.

### Making introductions at project reviews and public share-outs

* *Considerations*

  * Hold open houses to showcase project work and request feedback. Though going to staff is always good, you also want to balance that with inviting them to you. The tone you’re aiming for is: "You’ve invited us into your world, now we’d like to welcome you into ours."

  * When inviting staff to you, think about it as hosting them in your home:

    * Provide refreshments.

    * Serve guests when you can.

    * Introduce two people who have likely never needed to interact before.

    * Engage the quietest people in the room, and find them a conversation partner.

## Maintaining Open Lines of Communication

Now that you’ve built connections across the system, you’ve opened lines of communication with a diverse array of stakeholders. Here we describe several things to think about when maintaining the connections you’ve established:

* Send personal invitations for project reviews and public share-outs.

* Give people your card and encourage them to reach out to you.

* Call "sneezers" and other staff when you have questions they might be able to answer. Engage them and ask for their advice and help. This isn’t being a bother. This is building a relationship. In Austin, we’ve found that most people don’t get phone calls at work anymore and people are often surprised when they do. It’s also an efficient way to ping someone with a quick question and lets you visit with them briefly at the same time.

* When you make the first move to reach out, you will show staff that you meant it when you told them to reach out to you. When they have concerns or questions, they are more likely to express those to you. And when they do, recognize their feedback as valuable intel that helps the team do better work, even if you’re not going to resolve an issue in the way that person requested.

## Working through Disagreement and Tension

Being able to successfully engage city staff comes down to building relationships that can support tough conversations on complex issues. You’ve engaged the partnering organization in meaningful conversations that span from [leadership](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-1-learning-from-the-organization#emphasizing-project-planning-conversations) to the [frontlines](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-1-learning-from-the-organization#emphasizing-introduction-conversations). But you didn’t stop there, because you know the project team seeks whole-system transformation. So you’ve gone a step further to identify and [engage key players across the system](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-2-mapping-the-system-of-stakeholders#emphasizing-stakeholder-conversations) in meaningful conversations. With all your efforts spent building and maintaining connections across a diverse array of staff, you’ve developed the kinds of relationships that can weather the disagreement and tension that is 100% guaranteed whenever people with diverse perspectives tackle complex challenges. On top of that, you may find that you’re entering into organizations that have internal conflict completely unrelated to your project. It can be tough to know how to handle either type of situation. Below we’ve offered some practical tips for:

[Navigating organizational conflict](#navigating-organizational-conflict)

[Navigating difficult conversations](#navigating-difficult-conversations)

### Navigating organizational conflict

*Strategies:*

* Don’t shy away from what makes you different than the people you are trying to engage. They are sharing their world with you. Share your world with them. Show and tell them the tools of your trade and the location of your work, especially if those are the very things that you think could alienate them.

* Always be telling staff who you’ve engaged with previously and who you’re engaging with next.

  * You’ll recognize this as the bookend element within [general considerations](/digital-services-engagement-guide/part-1-learning-from-the-organization#general-considerations). When there is internal conflict, this goes far to offer transparency as well as communicate your neutrality and interest in honoring everyone’s perspective.

* Long-standing conflict is often perpetuated by a zero-sum mentality. Resist acknowledging this mentality.

  * You’ll likely notice that people in the organization describe their collaborative challenges in terms of win-lose. You acknowledge it when you hold back information on who you’ve talked to for fear of angering one group against another or losing trust from one if they find out you’re also talking to someone they’re in conflict with. You’ll inadvertently appear to be taking some sort of side even if staff can’t figure out which. What’s really interesting is taking sides won’t even help you build trust with the side you’ve taken! By siding with them, you’ll be seen as one-sided and therefore there’s potential that in the future you might be on the other side. When you show you’re neutral, you build trust and you are showing that this project can provide wins across conflicting perspectives.

* Don’t inherit relationships. Build your own. PERIOD!

* Pay attention to language

  * When people correct your use of a word, acknowledge it and ask them why. Make note of this intel; you can take it back to the team and consider how to respond.

* Affirm shared insights with "Ok", not “right”.

  * When talking to staff who refer to other staff, acknowledge their perspective with "ok", “I see,” “got it,” “understood.” Steer clear of saying “right.” Though seemingly trivial, you don’t want to indicate agreement and threaten your neutrality, indicate empathy instead and you’ll still build rapport while staying neutral.

### Navigating difficult conversations

*Strategies:*

* Detach.detach.detach.

  * What is your minimum viable product? Fight for only that. You’re modeling the kind of behavior that you want staff to adopt when they collaborate amongst themselves.

* There’s tension in the air. Stop and ask yourself and your team why.

  * Is this an organizational readiness issue or an issue of the organization not understanding the approach of your work? Find the root of the tension before you try to address it. To find out, focus on clarifying the approach to the work and reaching agreement on that. Then reassess where everyone is at. If issues remain, then there’s reason to think tension exists because of the content of your work rather than its approach.

* When staff become alarmed or fearful or critical, this is your signal that useful information is there for you to learn. Ask why.

  * Everyone has a running narrative of their work and what it means to them. Fears related to turf or ownership can seem like annoyances to a fearless team of innovators when in fact these are signals that you can learn more about the reality of the work. The more you understand the daily realities, the better you can design for constraints.

* When staff share concerns with you, validate.

  * Sometimes, an opportunity to talk through a concern (a genuine frank conversation about constraints and realities) is remedy enough even if what’s causing the concern can’t be changed.

  * *Sample script*

    * "Here’s what I got from that, can I check with you to make sure I understood you right?"

    * "I’d like to dig a little deeper so I can gain an appreciation for what this means to you. You say you’re concerned with [problem], what issue is that causing you or what do you think would happen if we continued with that?"

    * "I’m hearing you say that you’re interested in [their goal]. And what I’m trying to accomplish is [project goal]. Let’s see if there’s another way for us to work that won’t affect your work."

## Summary

You are well on your way to creating enduring transformation, in collaboration with a diverse array of key players by your side. Our goal with this guide is to share the strategies and approach that have worked for us at the Austin Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellowship. And we hope, spark additional conversations on how to further refine and develop this approach to meet the ever-evolving needs of whole-system transformation. Innovating products and services is a tall order, and we believe that focusing on the people who make that innovation happen is the key to success.
