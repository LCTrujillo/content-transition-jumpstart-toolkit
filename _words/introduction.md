## Introduction

We are changing the way that we deliver digital services to residents. Hopefully, you’ve heard of the digital services project that is underway. If not, please [learn more about the project here](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/austin-digital-services-discovery/about/what-we-are-doing/).

We’re helping departments transition their content to a prototype platform, ensuring that it is service-oriented, written and structured to meet the needs of residents.

We’re currently working with the project’s advisors and executives to develop the schedule for transitioning department services to the site and will let you know what that order will be.

In the meantime, we’ve developed a toolkit to help your department jumpstart the process and help you get ready to make the transition.
